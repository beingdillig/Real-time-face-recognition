# Real-time-face-recognition

real-time face recognition application using Python, leveraging the face_recognition library for facial detection and encoding, and OpenCV for video processing. The primary goal of this project was to build a system capable of identifying and distinguishing between individuals in a live video feed by matching their facial features with pre-stored images.

Key Features:
Face Detection and Recognition:
The application accurately detects faces in a live video feed using pre-trained models from the face_recognition library. Each detected face is then compared with a set of preloaded images to determine its identity.

Dynamic Facial Encoding:
Known faces were preprocessed by loading their images, extracting facial encodings (unique 128-dimensional feature vectors), and storing them for comparison during runtime. This encoding technique ensures precise identification even with variations in lighting, angles, or facial expressions.

Video Processing with OpenCV:
The project integrated OpenCV to capture real-time video streams from the webcam. The frames were resized and processed to optimize performance and reduce computational overhead without sacrificing accuracy.

Interactive User Interface:
The system overlays rectangles around detected faces and dynamically displays names of recognized individuals on the video feed. Unrecognized faces are labeled as "Unknown," ensuring a user-friendly interaction.

Efficient Matching Algorithm:
To identify individuals, the application used the compare_faces and face_distance functions to calculate similarities between detected and known face encodings. The nearest match was selected based on minimal face distance, ensuring robust and reliable recognition.

Challenges and Solutions:
Handling Large Frames in Real-Time:
To optimize performance, each video frame was resized by 75% before processing, reducing the computational load without compromising accuracy.
Variations in Image Quality:
Variations in lighting and angles posed challenges during recognition. Preprocessing the images and using robust facial encoding algorithms helped mitigate these issues.
Multiple Face Detection:
The application was designed to process multiple faces in a single frame, with independent identification for each detected face.
Libraries and Technologies Used:
face_recognition: For facial feature detection, encoding, and matching.
OpenCV: For video capture and frame manipulation.
NumPy: For efficient array manipulations and encoding operations.
Workflow:
Preprocessing:
Load images of known individuals (e.g., "Varun.jpg" and "Aman.jpg").
Detect faces in these images and encode their unique facial features.
Video Stream Initialization:
Access the webcam using OpenCV to capture real-time video.
Resize each frame to enhance performance.
Face Detection and Recognition:
Detect all faces in the current frame and encode their features.
Compare the encodings with the stored data to identify faces.
Visualization:
Draw rectangles around each detected face.
Display names of recognized individuals or "Unknown" for unrecognized faces.
User Interaction:
Continuously process frames and update results in real-time until the user exits the application by pressing 'q'.
